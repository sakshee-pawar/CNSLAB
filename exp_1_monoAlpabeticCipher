A Mono-alphabetic cipher is a type of substitution cipher where each letter of the 
plaintext is replaced by a fixed different letter of the alphabet. 
The substitution rule is consistent throughout the message, 
meaning the same plaintext letter will always be replaced by the same 
ciphertext letter.

***Mono-alphabetic Shift Cipher (also called Caesar Cipher)***
A mono-alphabetic shift cipher is a cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

***Mono-alphabetic Substitution Cipher***
A mono-alphabetic substitution cipher replaces each letter of the plaintext with a different, fixed letter according to a random substitution rule, rather than a fixed shift.
