***Vigenere Cipher***
The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that improves upon the simple 
Caesar Cipher by using a keyword to shift letters, making it more resistant to frequency 
analysis attacks. 
**Encryption Process** 
Repeat the Key: 
• The key is repeated or extended to match the length of the plaintext. 
Convert Letters to Numbers: 
• Each letter in the plaintext and key is converted to a numerical value (A = 0, B = 1, ..., 
Z = 25). 
Apply the Vigenère Formula: 
• Each plaintext letter is shifted forward by the corresponding key letter’s value. 
• Formula: Ci=(Pi+Ki) mod 26 Ci = (Pi + Ki) mod 26 Ci=(Pi+Ki)mod26 
• The resulting value is converted back to a letter to form the ciphertext. 
**Decryption Process** 
Repeat the Key: 
• The key is repeated to match the length of the ciphertext. 
Convert Letters to Numbers: 
• Each ciphertext and key letter is converted to its numerical equivalent. 
Apply the Reverse Vigenère Formula: 
• The ciphertext letter is shifted backward using the key letter’s value. 
• Formula: Pi=(Ci−Ki)mod  26 Pi = (Ci - Ki) mod 26Pi=(Ci−Ki)mod26 
• The resulting value is converted back to a letter to recover the plaintext. 

***PlayFair Cipher***
The Playfair Cipher is a digraph substitution cipher that encrypts text in pairs of letters 
(digraphs) instead of individual characters, making it more secure than simple substitution 
ciphers like the Caesar or Vigenère Cipher. It was invented by Charles Wheatstone in 1854 
but was named after Lord Playfair, who promoted its use. 
**Encryption Process** 
Key Matrix Generation 
• A 5×5 matrix is created using the given key. 
• The key is written first, followed by the remaining letters of the alphabet (excluding 'J', 
which is merged with 'I'). 
• Duplicates are removed, and letters are placed row-wise. 
Text Preparation 
• The plaintext is converted to uppercase, and 'J' is replaced with 'I'. 
• It is then split into digraphs (pairs of two letters). 
• If a pair contains repeated letters, an 'X' is inserted between them. 
• If the last pair has a single letter, an 'X' is added as padding. 
*Encryption Rules* 
• Same Row: Each letter is replaced with the next letter in the row (circular shift). 
• Same Column: Each letter is replaced with the next letter in the column (circular shift). 
• Rectangle Rule: If letters form a rectangle, they are swapped with the corresponding 
letter in the same row but opposite column. 
Formula: 
• If letters are in same row → shift right 
• If letters are in same column → shift down 
• If letters form a rectangle → swap column positions
**Decryption Process** 
Key Matrix Retrieval 
• The same 5×5 matrix is generated using the given key. 
*Decryption Rules* 
• Same Row: Each letter is replaced with the previous letter in the row.
• Same Column: Each letter is replaced with the previous letter in the column. 
• Rectangle Rule: Opposite corners are swapped back. 
Formula: 
• If letters are in same row → shift left 
• If letters are in same column → shift up 
• If letters form a rectangle → swap back to original column 
Remove Extra 'X' 
• The inserted 'X' (used for breaking repeated letters) may be removed if it doesn't change 
the original meaning.
