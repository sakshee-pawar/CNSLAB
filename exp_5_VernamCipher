The Vernam cipher, also known as the one-time pad, is a symmetric key cipher that operates 
using a key of the same length as the plaintext. 
**Encryption Process** 
Plaintext & Key Alignment: 
• Each letter in the plaintext and the key is converted to a numerical value using its 
position in the alphabet (A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25). 
Addition with Key: 
• Each plaintext letter's numeric value is added to the corresponding key letter's numeric 
value. 
Modulo 26 Operation: 
• The sum is taken modulo 26 to ensure that the result remains within the alphabet range. 
Conversion Back to Character: 
• The resulting numeric value is converted back to its respective letter to form the 
ciphertext. 

**Decryption Process** 
Ciphertext & Key Alignment: 
• Each letter in the ciphertext and the key is converted to a numerical value. 
Subtraction with Key: 
• Each ciphertext letter's numeric value is subtracted by the corresponding key letter's 
numeric value. 
Modulo 26 Operation: 
• The result is taken modulo 26 to ensure it remains within the alphabet range. 
Conversion Back to Character: 
• The resulting numeric value is converted back to a letter to retrieve the original plaintext.
