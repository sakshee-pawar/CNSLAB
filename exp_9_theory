***Network reconnaissance:*** 
Network reconnaissance is the process of gathering information about a target network to 
identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited. It is commonly used by ethical hackers for 
security assessments and by attackers for malicious purposes. Reconnaissance can be active 
(direct interaction with the target) or passive (indirect methods like monitoring network traffic 
or searching public records). 

***WHOIS -***
used to retrieve domain registration information from publicly available databases. 
It provides details such as the domain owner, contact information, 
registrar, registration and expiration dates, and name servers. 
 **cmd -**
    whois google.com (Install with sudo apt install whois if needed)

***dig (Domain information groper)***
 It retrieves information like IP addresses, mail servers, and name 
servers associated with a domain. 
It is commonly used by network administrators and security analysts for troubleshooting DNS 
issues and checking domain configurations. 
 **cmd -**
    dig google.com

***Traceroute -***
The traceroute command (or tracert in Windows) is used to trace the path that packets take 
from a source to a destination across a network. It helps identify the number of hops (routers) 
between two devices and detects network delays or failures. Each hop in the output represents 
a router along the path, displaying its IP address and response time. This command is useful 
for diagnosing slow connections, detecting routing loops, and identifying network congestion.
 **cmd -**
    tracert google.com (windows)
    traceroute google.com (Linux)

***Nslookup -***
The nslookup (Name Server Lookup) command is used to query DNS records and retrieve 
information about domain names, IP addresses, and mail servers. It helps in troubleshooting 
DNS issues and verifying domain configurations. Unlike dig, which provides more detailed 
output, nslookup is simpler and available on both Windows and Linux for quick DNS lookups.
